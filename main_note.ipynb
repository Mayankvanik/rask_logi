      "Understanding Residual Networks (ResNet) in Deep Learning | by Kevin Akbari | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inMember-only storyUnderstanding Residual Networks (ResNet) in Deep LearningKevin AkbariÂ·Follow3 min readÂ·Apr 15, 2024--1ShareResidual Networks, or ResNets, stand as a cornerstone in the domain of deep learning, offering significant improvements in training deep neural networks while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. In this blog post, weâll delve into the mathematics behind ResNets, explore their architectural innovations, and provide Python code for implementation.BackgroundBefore the advent of ResNets, deeper neural networks struggled to converge during training due to the vanishing gradient problem. As the network depth increased, gradients became increasingly small, making it difficult for earlier layers to learn meaningful representations. ResNets address this issue by introducing skip connections, enabling the flow of information across layers more efficiently.Residual Block ArchitectureThe fundamental building block of ResNets is the residual block, which consists of multiple layers with skip connections. There are different variations of residual blocks, but the most common ones include:Identity Block: The simplest form of a residual block, where the input is added directly to the output without any transformations.Convolutional Block: Introduces convolutional layers within the residual block to learn more complex mappings.Residual learning: a building block.----1FollowWritten by Kevin Akbari46 FollowersI enjoy exploring data science and delving into cutting-edge models currently utilized in various industries. https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinakbari/FollowHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams\n"
